## Bugs
    - Fixed: Crouching movement animation was too fast when very small.

### Note:
I have updated the customization and management of profile saves.
Go to **Game Settings -> Customization**, where you'll see "Action Needed." Click on it to automatically update your customization save.
As a precaution, make a backup of your skins to avoid losing them (use the JSON export/import feature).
